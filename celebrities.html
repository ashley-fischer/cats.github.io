  Oskar had a condition called microphthalmia, which means his eyes never fully developed because of genetic abnormalities. Even though he could not see, Oskar could function perfectly well using his other senses, and was happy and healthy. Many who met
  him for the first time never even realize he was completely blind. Oskar's best friend, "The Klaus", is a former stray that was adopted in 2006 by the same couple. He lives in Seattle with Mick, and Bethany, and formerly with Oskar. In 2014, they published
  a book about the cats' adventures titled Oskar and Klaus Present: The Search for Bigfoot.<sup>[87]</sup> On February 5, 2018, Oskar died, likely due to heart failure.<sup>[88]</sup>
