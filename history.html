  <p>
    Humans have always had a close relationship with cats, and the animals have long been a subject of short films, including the early silent movies Boxing Cats (1894) and The Sick Kitten (1903).<sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup>Harry Pointer (1822–1889) has
    been cited as the "progenitor of the shameless cat picture".<sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup> Cats have been shared via email since the internet's rise to prominence in the 1990s.<sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup> The first cat video on YouTube was uploaded in 2005
    by YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, who posted a video of his cat called "Pajamas and Nick Drake".<sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup> The following year, "Puppy vs Cat" became the first viral cat video; uploaded by a user called Sanchey (a.k.a. Michael Wienzek);<sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup>
    as of 2015 it had over 16 million views on YouTube.<sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup> In a Mashable article that explored the history of cat media on the Internet, the oldest entry was an ASCII art cat that originated on 2channel, and was a pictorial representation
    of the phrase "Please go away."<sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup>

    The New York Times described cat images as "that essential building block of the Internet".<sup>[9]</sup> In addition, 2,594,329 cat images had been manually annotated in flickr.com by users.<sup><sup>[10]</sup> </sup>An interesting phenomenon is
    that many photograph owners tag their house cats as "tiger".<sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup>

    Eric Nakagawa and Kari Unebasami started the website I Can Haz Cheezburger in 2007, where they shared funny pictures of cats. This site allowed users to create LOLcat memes by placing writing on top of pictures of their cats. This site now has more than
    100 million views per month and has "created a whole new form of internet speak".<sup>[6]</sup> In 2009, the humour site Urlesque deemed September 9 "A Day Without Cats Online", and had over 40 blogs and websites agree to "[ban] cats from their
    pages for at least 24 hours".<sup>[12]</sup> As of 2015, there are over 2 million cat videos on YouTube alone, and cats are one of the most searched keywords on the internet.<sup>[6]</sup> CNN estimated that in 2015 there could be around 6.5 billion
    cat pictures on the internet.<sup>[13]</sup> The internet has been described as a "virtual cat park, a social space for cat lovers in the same way that dog lovers congregate at a dog park".<sup>[14]</sup> The Daily Telegraph deemed Nyan Cat the most
    popular internet cat,<sup>[15]</sup> while NPR gave this title to Grumpy Cat.<sup>[16]</sup> The Daily Telegraph also deemed the best cat video on YouTube as "Surprised Kitty (Original)", which currently has over 75 million views.<sup>[17]</sup> Buzzfeed
    deemed Cattycake the most important cat of 2010.<sup>[18]</sup>

    In 2015, an exhibition called "How Cats Took Over The Internet" opened at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York.<sup>[19]</sup> The exhibition "looks at the history of how they rose to internet fame, and why people like them so much".<sup>[6]</sup>    There is even a book entitled How to Make Your Cat an Internet Celebrity: A Guide to Financial Freedom.<sup>[20]</sup> The annual Internet Cat Video Festival celebrated and awards the Golden Kitty to cat videos.<sup>[21]</sup> According to Star Tribune,
    the festival's success is because "people realized that the cat video they'd chuckled over in the privacy of their homes was suddenly a thousand times funnier when there are thousands of other people around".<sup>[22]</sup> The Daily Telegraph had
    an entire article devoted to International Cat Day.<sup>[23]</sup> EMGN wrote an article entitled "21 Reasons Why Cats And The Internet Are A Match Made in Heaven".<sup>[24]</sup>

    In 2015, there were more than 2 million cat videos on YouTube, with an average of 12,000 views each – a higher average than any other category of YouTube content.<sup>[25]</sup> Cats made up 16% of views in YouTube's "Pets & Animals" category, compared
    to dogs' 23%.<sup>[26]</sup> The YouTube video Cats vs. Zombies merged the two internet phenomena of cats and zombies.<sup>[27]</sup> Data from BuzzFeed and Tumblr has shown that dog videos have more views than those of cats, and less than 1% of posts
    on Reddit mention cats.<sup>[28]</sup> While dogs are searched for much more than cats, there is less content on the internet.<sup>[29]</sup> The Facebook page "Cats" has over 2 million likes while Dogs has over 6.5 million.<sup>[30]</sup> In an Internet
    tradition, The New York Times Archives Twitter account posts cat reporting throughout the history of the NYT.<sup>[31]</sup><sup>[32]</sup> The Japanese prefecture of Hiroshima launched an online Cat Street View, which showed the region from the perspective
    of a cat.<sup>[33]</sup><sup>[34]</sup>

    Abigail Tucker, author of The Lion in the Living Room, a history of domestic cats, has suggested that cats appeal particularly because they "remind us of own faces, and especially of our babies...<sup>[they're]</sup> strikingly human but also perpetually
    deadpan".<sup>[35]</sup><sup>[36]</sup>
